1. Web Server is designed to serve HTTP Content. while Application Server can also serve HTTP Content but is not limited to just
   HTTP. It can be provided other protocol support such as RMI/RPC.
   The main purpose of a web server is to make the static content accessible for the users to view on the web browsers. The job
   of an application server is to host and expose business logic applications and processes using several different protocols. It
   works in conjunction with the web server.

2.Application Server
	-- Oracle WebLogic
	-- Tomcat
	-- WebSphere Application Server
	-- Oracle GlassFish Server
	-- Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  Web Server
	-- Apache http Server
	-- Nginx
	-- Lighttpd
	-- Microsoft IIS

3. Java Servlets are programs that run on a Web or Application server and act as a middle layer between a requests coming from a
Web browser or other HTTP client and databases or applications on the HTTP server.Since a servlet is integrated with the Java
language, it also possesses all the Java features such as high portability, platform independence, security and Java database
connectivity. 

4. Tomcat Directory Structure
	
	/bin -- Startup/shutdown scripts for tomcat and also consists of JAR files with classes required to control tomcat
	        server.
	/conf -- Configuration files, including modules.xml, server.xml, and a number of apps-<name>.xml.
	/lib -- Jar files that are used for starting and stopping Tomcat.
	/logs -- This is where Tomcat places its log files by default.
	/temp -- Temporary File Storage.
	/webapps -- Sample web applications. Any .war files placed here will be automatically expanded.
 	/work -- Tomcat`s working directory where Tomcat places all servlets that are generated from JSPs.
	/classes -- Any class that you add to this directory will find its place in Tomcat's classpath. 

5. #vim /opt/tomcat/conf/server.xml
	--Here change----

	<Connector port="8081" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443" />

	--change connector port to any port you want eg. 8082------
	
	<Connector port="8082" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443" />
	
	Save and exit.
	Go to browser
	type http://http://127.0.0.1:8082/

6. Installing Tomcat

   #wget http://mirrors.fibergrid.in/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.34/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.34.tar.gz
   #tar xvzf apache-tomcat-8.5.34.tar.gz 
   #sudo mv apache-tomcat-8.5.34 /opt/tomcat

   --Run tomcat by following command
	#$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh 

   Instaling Nginx
   
   #sudo apt-get install nginx
   
   --Now go to /etc/nginx/conf
	create a tomcat-proxy-pass.conf file and add following line
	
	server {
  		listen 80;
  		server_name tomcatproxy.com;
 
      location / {
    		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8081/;
   		}
	}

Note: Here tomcat is running on port 8081 and nginx is runnning on port 80

    --Now open /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
	and comment the following line
		#include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
	save and exit
    --Now open web browser type http:localhost 
	now its show tomcat homapage

-----------Additional Exercise-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. #wget http://mirrors.fibergrid.in/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.34/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.34.tar.gz
   #tar xvzf apache-tomcat-8.5.34.tar.gz 
   #sudo mv apache-tomcat-8.5.34 /opt/tomcat

2. #sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
	here export the enviroment variable to .bashrc file
	#vim .bashrc	
	add--
		export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
		export CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat


3. Create two Directories named Tomcat1 and Tomcat2
 
	--Extract the tomcat tar file and copy to Tomcat1 and tomcat2
   On Tomcat1
	-- Open the file conf/server.xml
	   #vim conf/server.xml
		
	leave server port as it is eg 8005 and leave the connector port as it is eg 8080 dont edit anything here

   On Tomcat2
	-- open the file conf/server.xml
	    #vim conf/server.xml

	Here change the server port to 8055 and coonnector port to 9090 
	save and exit

   Now open the web browser and open localhost:8080 in tab1 and localhost:9090 in tab2.
   here both the tomcat instances are running.

4. Go to Tomcat1/conf/server.xml
	here change the connector port to 8080
	save and exit
   Now go to Tomcat2/cnf/server.xml
	here change the connector port to 9090 and also change the server port to 8055
	save and exit

5.For Instance 1-----
 
	Create a Directory hello inside Tomcat1/webapps/
	in Directory hello create a index.html page with below content
		
		<html>
		<head>
		<title>"Hello, World" Application</title>
		</head>
		<h1>"Hello, World" Application This is First Tomcat Instance</h1>
		<p>This is the home page for a sample application used to illustrate the
		source directory organization of a web application utilizing the principles
		outlined in the Application Developer's Guide.
		<p>This is working Instance 1
		</body>
		</html>

   Save it and go to browser and run localhots:8080/hello

  For Instance 2-----

	Create a Directory hello inside Tomcat2/webapps/
	in Directory hello create a index.html page with below content
		
		<html>
		<head>
		<title>"Hello, World" Application</title>
		</head>
		<h1>"Hello, World" Application This is Second Tomcat Instance</h1>
		<p>This is the home page for a sample application used to illustrate the
		source directory organization of a web application utilizing the principles
		outlined in the Application Developer's Guide.
		<p>This is working Instance 2
		</body>
		</html>

   Save it and go to browser and run localhots:9090/hello

6.  --Go to /etc/nginx/conf
	create a tomcat1-proxy-pass.conf file and add following line
	
	server {
  		listen 80;
  		server_name tomcatproxy.com;
 
      location / {
    		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello/;
   		}
	}

Note: Here tomcat first instance is running on port 8080 and nginx is runnning on port 80


7.Create a Bash Script named TomcatInstall.sh
	Add the below lines

#!/bin/bash

echo "Your Tomcat is Start Downloading"
sudo wget http://mirrors.fibergrid.in/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.34/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.34.tar.gz
TOMCAT=apache-tomcat-8.5.34
TOMCAT_ARCHIVE=$TOMCAT.tar.gz

if [ ! -r $TOMCAT_ARCHIVE ]; then
	echo "Tomcat could not be downloaded." 1>&2
	echo "Verify that wget is installed." 1>&2
	echo "If YES,  check your internet connection and try again." 1>&2
	echo "You may also download $TOMCAT_ARCHIVE and place it in this folder." 1>&2
	exit 1
else
	echo "Your $TOMCAT is Downloaded"
fi

#This is your Tomcat Installation Directory
sudo mkdir /opt/tomcat

sudo tar xvzf $TOMCAT_ARCHIVE
sudo r -rf $TOMCAT_ARCHIVE
sudo mv $TOMCAT  /opt/tomcat
echo "Your Tomcat is Installed"
echo "For Running your Tomcat Go to Directory /opt/tomcat/bin"
echo "Then Run the startup.sh"

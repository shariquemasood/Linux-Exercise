1. the size of MBR is 512 bytes
	and it store the address of grub loader

2. update-rc.d apache2 defaults
	syntax: update-rc.d servicetostart defaults

3. init 6

4. service cron restart

5. create a partision then formate it with below command 
	sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb4

6. sudo mount /dev/sdb4 /mnt/partition1
	if we want permanent mount then we have to make this entry to fstab file.


7. LVM is a disk management approach 
	that allows us to create, extend, 
	reduce, delete or resize the volume 
	groups or logical volumes.

   RAID is either a software or a hardware 
	technique to create data storage 
	redundancy across multiple block 
	devices based on required RAID levels.
        By configuring RAID you are just providing 
	an emergency substitute for the Primary disk.

8. Steps: 1. create a physical volume(pv) by creating one or more partition from disk
	     after that
             pvcreate /dev/sda6 /dev/sda7
	  2. create volume group(vg) from pv
	     vgcreate vol_grp1 /dev/sda6 /dev/sda7
	  3. create logical volume form vg
	     lvcreate -l 20 -n logical_vol1  vol_grp1
	  4. Now fomate the newly created lv
	     mkfs.ext3 /dev/vol_grp1/logical_vol1
	  5. Now mount the lv

9. sudo apt-get install mdadm
	create two partition(which act as a disk)
	/dev/sda1 /dev/sda2

	mdadm -E /dev/sda{1,2}
	mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda{1,2}
	cat /proc/mdstat
	mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0
	mkdir /mnt/raid1
	mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid1/


10. sudo fallocate -l 500M /swapfile
    sudo mkswap /swapfile 
    sudo swapon /swapfile
    swapon -s

11. sudo chgrp admin file1
    sudo chown test file2

12. A sticky bit is a permission bit that is set on a directory that allows only the owner of the 	file within that directory (root has all the permission) to make chnages or delete  the 		file . No other user has the needed privileges to make changes or delete the file created 	by some other user the other user can only read.

13. sudo adduser linux
	passwd linux
    sudo usermod -g admin linux

14. sudo passwd -l linux
15. make below changes to /etc/sudoers file
	linux ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

16. sudo deluser --remove-home --backup-to /tmp
	Then enter user name

17. tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' < us.txt > ls.txt

18. sudo nice -n -1 servicename
19. vi /etc/inetd.conf 
20. telnet 10.1.210.199 22
	netstat -pan | grep  :22
21. sudo crontab -e sharique
	45 23 * * 1 /usr/bin/echo "hello"
22. by default dig gives the ip information of a website along with nameserver
	while traceroute show the route from ip network to hosts.
